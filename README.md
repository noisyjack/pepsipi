# pepsipi

This is a little project to create a Raspberry Pi to dispense Syrup for a Sodastream.

Using this as a project to teach myself Python so likely to be fairly terrible.

Raspi takes 2 inputs and has 2 outputs.

- Action Button - Performs set action
- Mode Button - Changes the mode

- Buzzer 
- Motor Output
